An SMTP/ESMTP Client module for Node.js

Features:
- Very basic protocol implementation
- Very basic wrapper around the protocol to provide a bit of a nice interface for use in applications.

Issues:
- Experimental, I'm no genius when it comes to figuring out an RFC that was originally older then me. Use at your own risk, If you encounter problems, add them as an issue on the github project.
